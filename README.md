## Project Description: 

*  The Real-Time Sign Recognition project trains and utilizes a neural network for the purpose of identifying and displaying the name of the sign presented in front of the camera within the region of interest. 
*  For best results, the user's hand should be presented in front of a light background in a clearly lit room.
